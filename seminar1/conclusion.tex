\section{My design choices}
\subsection{Keeping the original rows}
The current implementation imports the information from txt file and modifies
that object as the program progresses. This can be a problem in the future
if their is a need for keeping track of changes made or someone just want to keep
the original object while performing the CSA algorithm as well as sorting on a
clone.

A solution to this could be to implement an abstract LineStorage that implements
functionality such as "clone" and "equals". This would make it possible to clone
imported rows as well as comparing different LineStorage object with each other.
This functionality was not implemented in Laboration 1 as I decided this would not
be needed.
%\subsection{Saving to new format seamless}
%The decomposition structures allows for a different output format than input
%format. Though there is no good way of compying from one format to another even
%if a new IO format were to be supported in the future. One way of supporting this
%would be to implement an abstract implementation of IOkk
