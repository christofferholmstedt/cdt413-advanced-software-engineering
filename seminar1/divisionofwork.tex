\section{Division of work}
A good division of work would let one developer implement the input/output as well
as the LineStorage parts. This would give the developer the possibility to implement
a complete flow in the application import, "storage in memory" and then export.
The second developer would work with the shifting algorithm as well as the sorting.
A mock-up of the LineStorage would be needed for both tasks but as soon as that
would be complete both tasks take a LineStorage as input and do all operations on it.
