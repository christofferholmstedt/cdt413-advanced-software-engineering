\section{Analysis}
To help in the analysis a few papers have been used as references. First the
article {\em "What Makes Good Research in Software Engineering"} by Mary Shaw
\cite{shaw2002}. The second paper is the {\em "Case Studies for Method and Tool
Evaluation"} by Barbara Kitchenham, Lesley Pickard and Shari Lawrence Pfleeger
\cite{kitchenham1995}. The third and last is the {\em "Empirical Research in
Software Engineering"} by Claes Wohlin, Martin H\"{o}st and Kennet Henningsson
\cite{wohlin2003}.

\subsection{The Question}
The question is never clearly written down in a sentence or two, though from the
context it's easy to understand that the purpose with this paper is to prove that
the Extreme Programming method is a viable choice as a development method. This
fits under the question category, "Method or means of development" from Shaws
report \cite{shaw2002}.

\subsection{The Result}
The results presented in the paper can be categorised as "Answer/Judgment or a
report" in the types of results that Shaw presents \cite{shaw2002}. This
categorisation is mainly done by exclusion of the other "types of results". As
a logical answer to the question asked would be the actual procedures that
someone would take to introduce Extreme programming methadology for a development team but that is not what is
given in this paper instead it relies on the knowledge that other papers and books
present that information. Another category that comes close is the "Empirical
model" though no model is presented only empirical data.

\subsection{The Validation}
With a question and results some validation must be done. Abrahamsson goes
through his research method thoroughly and towards the end gives a
comprehensive discussion as well as listing all the conclusions without generalising
too heavily. I categorise this as persuasion when it comes to Shaws types of
validation \cite{shaw2002}. Abrahamsson also states that the findings here are
interesting and serves its purpose but {\em "[...] will continue to follow up
    the development process and will report the concrete results from the
project as a whole [...]"}. This indicates that the conclusions from the
    case study are interesting but should not be generalised too far.
