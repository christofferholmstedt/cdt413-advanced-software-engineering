\section{Introducation}
%\begin{abstract}
   This paper takes a closer look at two of the twelve principles of agile
   software development, identified in the Agile manifesto \cite{web:agilemanifesto}.
   This is done by identifying parts from Extreme Programming (XP)
   and Scrum which relates to the two selected principles.

   The first principle chosen is "The most efficient and effective method of
   conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face
   conversation."

   The second one is "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become
   more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.".

   Throughout the paper the principles will be referenced as "the first
   principle" and "the second principle" even though they occur in different
   orders on the official webpage \cite{web:agileprinciples}.

   As reference for how XP and Scrum works the "Embracing change with Extreme
   Programming" paper by Kent Beck \cite{beck99} and "The Scrum Software
   Development Process for Small Teams" paper by Linda Rising and Norman S.
   Janoff \cite{rising00} is used.
